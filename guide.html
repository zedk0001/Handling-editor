                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Thankfully, Grand Theft Auto V features a surprisingly comprehensive and detailed handling
                        physics system. While the engine simplifies very complex matters into only sets of two or three
                        variables, it does allow to make vehicles behave in a sufficiently complex manner that can
                        mimick IRL to a sufficient degree, allowing for concepts like weight transfer,
                        understeer/oversteer, wheelspin and per-wheel brake luckup to exist within the car's behavior on
                        the road.</p>

                    <p>V accomplishes this by implementing systems in an appropiate but simplified manner. For example
                        gearing actually modulates the car's acceleration depending on the gear, but torque isn't
                        actually a thing, as its just power scaled up and down by the gears. Wheels actually push (or
                        pull) the car forward, but the rim size on the model does not affect acceleration or speed given
                        the same power.</p>

                    <p>This guide is appropiate for both vanilla, lore-friendly and real vehicles, because the source of
                        the vehicle model is irrelevant. What's important is the style of handling you want it to have.

                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to understand a few things before embarking on creating/editing handling files to
                        your liking.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No section works isolated. Every thing you edit will partially affect other characteristics
                            of the car. Think of it as each item being a physical characteristic contributing to the
                            complete physical behavior of the car.</li>
                        <li>A good chunk of items do not work the same way their IRL counterparts do, they only
                            approximate.</li>

                        <span class="h2">Center of Mass</span> <br>
                        <small class="text-muted">vecCentreOfMassOffset</small>

                    <p>Starts as the model's center, visible with OpenIV's model viewer. <i>vecCentreOfMassOffset</i>
                        offsets it around so you can put the CoM wherever you want.</p>

                    <h4>Must-knows</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Y means ahead/behind, Z means up/down. You don't need to edit X (left/right) most
                            of the time.
                        </li>

                        <li>The car will pivot around the CoM while mid-air, but pivot around fRollCentreHeight while on
                            the ground.</li>
                        <li>The most balanced car will have a CoM sitting exactly between the axles.</li>
                        <li>
                            CoM is directly tied to fRollCentreHeight(Front/Rear) - together they control weight
                            transfer. Think of it as a line drawn from the CoM Z down to the fRollCentre. The longer it
                            is, the more weight transfer. Lowering CoM Z or raising fRollcentre reduces weight transfer,
                            overdo it and the car will never lean.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Where to put it</h4>
                    <p>Usually the CoM can go on the vehicle's center, Y sitting bewteen the axles and Z sitting right
                        below the engine's height.</p>

                    <p>Do keep in mind the Center of Mass is a great way to define the vehicle's intrinsic stability, as
                        you define how
                        well balanced it is. Think of it as a basic tendency you can put onto the car's chassis. </p>

                    <p class="text-center">
                        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x250?text=Low, Centered COM" class="h-75">
                    </p>

                    <p>A vehicle with a raised CoM (Z component) will tend to move around more, specially in landings
                        and mid-air. Here's how it looks:</p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x250?text=High, Centered COM" class="h-75">
                    </p>

                    <p>You can move the CoM forward or back to destabilize the vehicle in a different way, a bit more
                        complex than high-low. Front or Rear biased vehicles can react to this fact in a multitude of
                        ways, in general being more or less prone to understeer or oversteer. A bias front or back bias
                        can also enhance turn-in ability, and take-off and landing behavior.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>One of the most important aspects of Handling, grip defines how quickly the wheels can make the
                        car accelerate, decelerate, or change direction.</p>

                    <h4>Must-knows</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grip is measured in G-Forces, remember 1G is <b>9.8m/s</b> of acceleration.</li>

                        <li>The car will pivot around the CoM while mid-air, but pivot around fRollCentreHeight while on
                            the ground.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Interestingly, Grip is measured in G-Forces, which translate to how fast the wheels can
                        accelerate-decelerate the car before starting to skid. This ties in directly with braking and
                        torque, which also are measured in G-Forces. If there's not enough grip to accomodate torque or
                        braking, the wheels are overwhelmed and will lose traction.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><i>fTractionCurveMax</i>: Defines the base maximum ammount of Gs the vehicle is able to work with.
                        </li>
                        <li><i>fTractionCurveMin</i>: Defines the base minimum ammount of Gs the vehicle has when skidding or
                            losing traction.</li>
                        <li><i>fTractionCurveLateral</i>: In degrees, acts as the tire slip angle. The tires will get the best
                            grip at the top half of this value</li>
                        <li><i>fTractionLossMult</i>: Defines how griploss scales on troublesome surfaces like grass, dirt or
                            snow. Check materials.meta to know how much grip each surface detracts.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <span class="h5">Bodyroll & Suspension Pressure effects on Grip</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, V simulates grip gains (and loses) from suspension pressure. This means that on
                        whichever tires the car is leaning to, get a significant ammount of traction, while tires on the
                        other side lose traction.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is best seen on FWD vehicles, which have a real hard time getting traction on launch. If you
                        reduce bodyroll or move the center of gravity forward, the issue is greatly reduced.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Only roads make the most of the vehicles' grip, and other surfaces like grass, dirt,plastic,
                        concrete
                        and snow reduce the overall grip. fTractionLossMult scales how important the effect is.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><i>fBrakeForce</i> applies <b>per wheel.</b> So don't put it equal to <i>fTractionCurveMax</i>, use about a 1/4 of it. Or 1/X where X is the nº of wheels on your thing.</li>
                        <li><i>fBrakeBiasFront</i> at 0.5 delivers the same brake pressureto all axles. 1.0 only delivers to the front axles, 0.0 only delivers to the rear.</li>
                        <li>A well balanced <i>fBrakeBiasFront</i> allows full control of the car under heavy braking, this balance usually is between 0.55 and 0.7. You can produce oversteer by using a lower value, and understeer if using a higher value.</li>

                        <small class="text-muted">fInitialDragCoeff, fDownforceModifier</small>
                    </p>
                    <hr>

                    <span class="h5">Air Drag</span>

                    <p>Air Drag is presented as a force that acts against the car's velocity, and tries to slow it down.
                    </p>
                    <p>In V, air drag scales with the square of speed, but fInitialDragCoeff modifies the scaling so air
                        drag actually scales the way you need it to.</p>
                    <p>Air Drag can be measured in Gs, which presents how fast you are decelerated at certain speed.</p>

                    <p>Due to V's vehicle engines outputting "torque" in Gs, both values can be compared easily, which
                        gives
                        us more information about the vehicles' performance.
                        For example, as both the Gs from torque and the Gs from air drag even out, the vehicle stops
                        accelerating - at that speed, the vehicle can't push through the air anymore. You got your real
                        top
                        speed.</p>

                    <span class="h5">Downforce</span>

                    <p>This is one of the most arcade systems in V. Downforce translates directly to grip gain on the
                        wheel,
                        and can abide to wildly different rulesets depending on your needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        The base math goes as follows:<br>

                    <ul>

                        <span class="h5">Base</span>
                        <small class="text-muted">fDownforceModifier set to 1 or less</small>

                        <li>0.035Gs, double (0.07Gs) if a Spoiler is installed.</li><br>
                        <span class="h5">Dynamic</span>
                        <small class="text-muted"> fDownforceModifier between 1.01 and 99.99</small>

                        <li>0Gs as the car is stopped, which ramps up to 0.035Gs as the car reaches its top speed.
                            Double
                            that if a Spoiler is installed.</li>
                        <li>The value is multiplied by fDownforceModifier, so a modifier of x10 would net you 0.35Gs
                            gain
                            per wheel, double that with a Spoiler.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="h5">Active Spoilers</span>

                    <p>Vehicles with active Spoilers ignore fDownforceModifier entirely.<br>There are two types of
                        active spoilers in V:</p>

                    <p>Raising type (Like the T20):
                    <ul>
                        <li>No gain when the spoiler is down. As the spoiler raises, you get 0.035Gs. When braking,
                            the
                            spoiler pitches, and you get 0.07Gs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Dynamic type (Like the X8 Proto):
                    <ul>
                        <li>0.035Gs when the spoiler is down. Over certain speed (60mph or so)it raises up to
                            0.042Gs.
                        </li>
                        <li>When cornering or braking, it gets to 0.07Gs.</li>

                        </p>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The base power is just a base value on top of which everything else works. Then, gearing
                        modulates that power simply multiplying it up and down (the ratio), which results in the torque
                        (also measured in Gs) sent to the wheels.</p>
                    <p>While the first and last gear's ratios are always the same (3.33 and 0.9) the gears in between
                        have different ratios depending on how many gears the engine has at its disposal. The more gears
                        it has, the smoother the torque drops from gear to gear - very few gears will result in an
                        incredibly high torque drop on the next gear.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind the ratios always have to go from 3.33 to 0.9, so the more steps you give them, the
                        smaller the jump between each gear.</p>
                    <p>Those gears stretch over the engine's top speed, naturally.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, while the car is busy switching gears, you have no power. How quick this happens is
                        defined by fClutchChangeRateScaleX.</p>

                    <p>There are three main players on deformation. </p>
                    <p>In vehicles.meta:
                        <li>damageMapScale: How precise the deformation is. Higher - smaller dent radius.</li>
                        <li>damageOffsetScale: How deep the deformation is. Higher - deeper deformation dents.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>In Handling.meta
                        <li>fDeformationDamageMult: Scales how much speed affects deformation damage. Higher - higher
                            deformation damage at the same speed.</li>

                        If you're not just following IRL stats, specs and quirks (which are fun on their own right if
                        you achieve them)...
                    </p>

                        To me, a fun handling is a reactive handling. A fun vehicle reacts to the driver and the
                        terrain. This means vehicles should never fully ignore bumps, slides, jumps, overall rough
                        driving. Half
                        the fun in driving is wrestling with the car when pushing it to its limit, or even past it.</p>

                        Often times, you only need to take care so it sits between the front and rear axles, so the
                        suspension doesn't lean back or ahead. Then adjust rollcentres until you get the desired base
                        bodyroll.

                        I personally prefer to get it somewhat right and move it up as much as it makes sense for the
                        car. This is a bit harder, but pays off when the car ends up tumbling around (This is GTA) and
                        actually rolls downhill properly. Helps with the personality too.
                    </p>
                    <span class="h5">Stability</span>
                    <p>As hard to work with as it is, vecInertiaMultiplier is very important to make cars heavier or
                        nimbler, and is responsible for the overall stability of the car. Do try to get it right.</p>
                    <span class="h5">Grip</span>
                    <p>Grip numbers are a good base, but vehicle stability is absolutely key to be able to make the
                        vehicle be able to use that grip. Just adjusting bodyroll, suspension strength and rebound you
                        can completely change
                        how much grip the car can actually use. </p>
                    <span class="h5">Downforce</span>
                    <p>Downforce is mandatory on almost every vehicle, doesn't matter the type or shape. I would only
                        avoid downforce in things like a semi</p>
                    <p>This is because, even at very low levels, downforce can be used</p>
                    <p>
                        Dynamic Downforce (>1.0) is great to make cars specialize on high speed cornering.
                    </p>
                    <p>Traction loss is more complex than numbers. You can make cars horrible offroading just by making
                        the suspension stiff or have little travel. fTractionLossMult is not that important.</p>
